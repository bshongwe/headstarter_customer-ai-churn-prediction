# üöÄ üìä Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning

This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to predict which customers are likely to stop using a service, also known as customer churn. The solution analyzes various customer behavioral and demographic data points‚Äîsuch as age, account balance, and activity history‚Äîto identify patterns associated with churn. By training multiple models, including **XGBoost, Random Forest, and SVM**, the project selects the best-performing model for deployment. The final model is deployed through an interactive **web app**, providing real-time predictions and actionable insights. In addition to predictions, the app offers personalized explanations of the factors driving each customer‚Äôs risk of churning. Businesses can use these insights to implement targeted retention strategies, boosting customer satisfaction and loyalty through automated engagement, such as personalized email campaigns.
